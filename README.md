# Lung-Cancer-Detection
Lung Cancer Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the classification of lung cancer types based on medical imaging data. The model is trained using a variety of convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures, including a custom CNN model and a pre-trained VGG16 model.
